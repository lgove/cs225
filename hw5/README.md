CS225 Final Project: Bounded Quantification
LeAnn Gove, Madison Anderson, Nikki Allen

This respository is to publish our research into the topic of Bounded Quanitification and our Ocaml construction of a small step semantics and type checker utilizing System F with abstraction as seen in the Bounded Quantification chapter of our text book.

Thus far we have a prototype of our implementation and some test cases for the encoded language. We based our work on homework 5 so to run our project, project.ml, simply call make within the folder it is held in which has a make file.
